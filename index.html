        <h2>The Games</h2>
        <p>Here are a bunch of games to help you to practise your guitar theory. There are three skills we strive to develop, and within each skill are three types of games. The skills are 1) Knowing the notes on your fretboard, 2) Knowing the intevals on your fretboard, 3) Knowing chords on your fretboard. Within each skill, the 3 games are 1) Identify: Seeing it played on the guitar, and being able to recognise what is being played. 2) Play: Can you play the notes we give you? 3) Read: given a score, can you read the note, and maybe play it too!</p>

                Either: picture of a guitar will appear. Which note is circled? To score high, be fast, and accurate! 
                </br>
                Or: we will give you a note and click the right note of the fretboard to get the point.
